### 📌 Project Description

**Spring Boot JDBC Demo - Automation Testing Framework**

This project showcases a lightweight Spring Boot application that demonstrates the integration of JDBC for interacting with relational databases. Designed with test automation in mind, it provides a foundation for validating data access layers and automating CRUD operations in Java-based microservices.

Key Features:
- ✅ **Spring Boot + JDBC**: Uses Spring Boot's powerful configuration and dependency injection features with native JDBC for database operations.
- 🧪 **Test Automation Ready**: Includes modular structure to facilitate integration with automation frameworks like TestNG, JUnit, and REST-assured for validating database and API functionality.
- 💾 **H2 In-Memory DB**: Simplifies testing and development with an embedded, in-memory H2 database.
- 🔄 **CRUD Operations**: Demonstrates clean implementation of create, read, update, and delete operations via `JdbcTemplate`.
- 📦 **Layered Architecture**: Organized into controller, service, DAO, and model layers following best practices for maintainable codebases.
- 🛠️ **Extendable Framework**: Can be extended for end-to-end test automation scenarios involving UI, API, and DB validations in enterprise environments.
